3. Code Standards

• Swift-specific:
```swift
// 4-space indentation
struct Test {
    let host: String
    func connect() async throws {
        guard isValid else { 
            throw HTTPError.invalidURL
        }
    }
}
```

• Avoid force unwrapping (!)

• Prefer protocol-oriented design

4. Testing

swift test --enable-test-discovery
